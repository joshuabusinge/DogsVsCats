# DogsVsCats
An algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats.
The dogs vs cats dataset refers to a dataset used for a Kaggle machine learning competition held in 2013. 
The dataset was originally used as a CAPTCHA (or Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), that is, a task that it is believed a human finds trivial, but cannot be solved by a machine, used on websites to distinguish between human users and bots.
